        "summary": "Variables are like labeled boxes where you can store information. In Python, you create a variable by giving it a name and assigning a value to it using the equals sign. For example, 'x = 5' creates a variable named 'x' that holds the number 5. You can use variables to store numbers, text, lists, and more, making your code reusable and easier to read.",

        "summary": "Loops allow you to repeat a block of code multiple times without rewriting it. There are two main types: 'for' loops, which iterate over a sequence (like a list), and 'while' loops, which keep running as long as a certain condition is true. Loops are essential for automating repetitive tasks.",

        "summary": "Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task. You define a function using the 'def' keyword, followed by the function name and parentheses. Functions can take inputs (called arguments) and return outputs. They help organize your code and avoid repetition.",

        "summary": "Agentic AI refers to AI systems that can autonomously pursue complex goals. Unlike passive chatbots that just answer questions, agents can plan, use tools (like web search or code execution), and take actions to complete tasks. They operate in loops of thought, action, and observation.",

        "summary": "The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standard for connecting AI models to external data and tools. It uses a Client-Host-Server architecture. The 'Host' (like an IDE) runs the 'Client', which connects to 'Servers' (like a database or file system tool). This allows AI to safely access your local resources.",
