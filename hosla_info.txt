 ○  Laksmi  Narayan  Acharya,  Birthday  Celebrant:  "In  70  years,  this  is  the  first  
time
 
someone
 
came
 
home
 
with
 
wishes.
 
Thanks
 
to
 
Shantanu
 
and
 
Hosla
 
for
 
the
 
artistic
 
gesture
 
with
 
our
 
family's
 
photos.
 
Grateful
 
from
 
the
 
heart."

 ○  Seuli  Hazra,  Participant:  "Ranjan  came  to  ask  about  mom's  health  even  before  I  
entered
 
home
 
after
 
the
 
doctor
 
visit.
 
That's
 
the
 
kind
 
of
 
trust
 
we
 
can
 
have
 
in
 
Hosla."
 ○  Arup  Ghosh  on  a  Hosla  Trip:  "Our  recent  trip  to  Andaman  Islands  was  
unforgettable.
 
As
 
we
 
are
 
70+
 
retired
 
persons
 
travelling
 
with
 
senior
 
citizens,
 
the
 
well
 
planned
 
tour
 
ensures
 
comfort,
 
accessibility
 
and
 
relaxation.
 
I
 
highly
 
recommend
 
it
 
for
 
safe,
 
thoughtfully
 
planned
 
journeys
 
for
 
everyone,
 
regardless
 
of
 
age!
 
"
 ○  Laxmi  Acharya,  Audience  Member:  "Kirtan,  Kavigaan,  Ramayan  songs  are  
vanishing
 
from
 
Bengali
 
culture.
 
Hosla's
 
initiative
 
is
 
a
 
precious
 
gift
 
to
 
our
 
generation.
 
Thanks
 
to
 
Hosla
 
for
 
reviving
 
this
 
art."
 ○  Mita  Sarkar  on  Hosla's  Wellness  Programs:  "I  am  getting  deep  sleep  with  the  
touch
 
of
 
Yoga
 
Nidra.
 
I
 
am
 
falling
 
asleep
 
before
 
the
 
audio
 
ends.
 
I
 
also
 
noticed...
 
by
 
doing
 
EFT,
 
the
 
pain
 
in
 
the
 
back
 
of
 
my
 
head...
 
is
 
gone.
 
I
 
have
 
benefited."
